# Item Protocol

The [**Item Protocol**](/protocol-concept/core.md) is an infrastructure for tokenization of the game items.

This protocol will provide a fast and convenient tokenization with a quick and easy integration of the market into particular games.

## Item

An item is a virtual object within a game that can be collected by a player or, occasionally, a non-player character.

## Item Market

The [**Item Market**](https://item.market) is a place where players can buy and sell items between each other in different blockchain games.

Payments on the Market are made with WAVES (which is the main token of the Waves platform.). WAVES can be purchased for roubles, dollars and other currencies, or earned on the Market itself by selling items earned in the game to other players.

The Item market will enable gamers to have true ownership over their virtual items. This will disrupt the virtual asset market by bringing blockchain technology to video games, enabling user-owned tokens that represent game items. In other words, the owner of the token is the person who actually has the item. And that token can be an object in a game, such as a sword, an in-game currency, or nearly anything else.
